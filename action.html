          <h4> save your vegetable water!</h4>
          <img>
          <p> at my house, my mom keeps a bucket in the sink where she dumps all the water from washing fruits and vegetables (no soap or oil). then she uses that water to water our plants or to rinse dishes before putting them in the dish washer. this way, you save water and money!</P>

          <h4> shop for clothes less often / secondhand! </h4>
          <img>
          <p> fast fashion is a huge contributor to landfill waste. by shopping less, or making more conscious purchases, you can reduce textile waste! another reason not to support fast fashion is that their workers are often paid little and work in harsh conditions. it's totally okay if you do buy from fast fashion brands if you need to though, remember, that companies are the ones that need to change their habits! you as a consumer are just trying to discourage companies from implementing those harmful practices by not buying from them. shopping secondhand gives clothing a second life and prevents the clothing from going to the landfill!

          <h4> shop at your local farmer's market!</h4>
          <img>
          <p> shopping at your local farmer's market not only supports your local community, but also reduces your carbon footprint and single-use plastic waste! local farmers don't have to drive their crops as far, so they use fewer fossil fuels to transport the crops from their farm to the market! at farmer's markets, they  </P>

          <h4> eat less meat and dairy! </h4>
          <img>
          <p> it takes a lot of energy and water to raise livestock, so eating less animal products means that less grain needs to be grown to feed the livestock and less water has to be used. growing the grain also takes water, energy and is sometimes related to deforestation (to clear land to grow the grain ). some alternatives to dairy are nut milks and other non-dairy products. for meat, some substitutions are beans and tofu, which are in many cases cheaper than meat!   </P>

          <h4> don't use plastic straws if you don't need them! </h4>
          <img>
          <p> of course, if you need to use plastic straws, go ahead! but know that there are other options, like paper, bamboo and metal straws! investing in a metal straw is a one time purchase, as long as you take good care of it. and sometimes, you just don't need a straw! normalize drinking out of cups without straws! </P>

        <h4> bring a reusable grocery bag when shopping! </h4>
        <img>
